<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>6+ years of IT Eperince. 
 Took 9 year of Career Break, looking farward to work again as Web Devloper. 
 
<!-- <p>No body was ready to invest on a women who has such a long carrer break. 
 In the begining I focused on Big companies. They all will take my interview some will get irritate and make me feel like I am wasting my time and there time. 
 Few will show intreast in my personal life and will ask me many personal questions like what made me to decide and take this decesion to join after 9 years of career break. 
 But no one was damn serious. Later joined a startup but coudnt continue there as I did not like the work enviornment. Since then I stopped the job hunting.
 Decided to do something on my own. </p> -->
